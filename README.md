# MEME Token
Simple ERC20 with hardhat scripts to deploy the token and then setup a uniswap v2 pool.

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
# Verify on Etherscan
npx hardhat verify --network sepolia <address> <constructor parameters>
